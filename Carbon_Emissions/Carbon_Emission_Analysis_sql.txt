Carbon Emission Analysis Project
Understanding carbon emissions across various industries is vital in tackling global climate change. With SQL, data analysts can uncover which sectors are the biggest polluters and track how these emissions have changed over time to aid in sustainable decision-making.
Dataset: Use this Carbon Emissions by Sector Dataset on Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/txtrouble/carbon-emissions] which includes emission data by industry, country, and year, along with greenhouse gas types like CO2, CH4, and N2O.
SQL Project Idea: Create a carbon tracking database in SQL. Then apply SQL commands like GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and HAVING to answer questions such as:

Which industry had the highest CO2 emissions in the most recent year?

What has been the trend of total emissions across sectors over the last decade?

Which industries showed a decline in emissions over the years?

How does the emission share differ across continents or economic zones?

Identify the top three emitting industries and their year-wise emission pattern.

Here's a **professional and structured write-up** for your *Regional Emissions Analysis* project. You can include this in your portfolio, presentation, or project documentation.

Regional Emissions Analysis – SQL Project Report

Overview

Understanding regional and sector-based carbon emissions is crucial for shaping sustainable environmental policies and tracking climate change contributors. This SQL-based data analysis project explores carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions across industries, regions, and countries over time. Using PostgreSQL, we query a synthetic but realistic dataset (`regional_emissions`) to derive insights that can guide decision-making toward reducing global emissions.

## Dataset Description

The `regional_emissions` table contains records of emissions-related indicators by industry, country, and year. Each row represents a unique industry-country-year observation.

## SQL Analysis Summary

### 1. **Top Emitting Industry in the Most Recent Year**

We identified the highest emitting sector in the latest year of data using aggregate queries with `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`.

### 2. **Emissions Trend Over Time**

Using a decade-spanning trend analysis, we found how global emissions rose or fell across years and sectors.

### 3. **Industries with Declining Emissions**

Filtering for industries that showed a drop in total CO₂ from 2013 to 2023 provided insight into sectors adopting cleaner technologies.

### 4. **Regional Emission Distribution**

Emissions were summed by `Region`, revealing which continents contribute most to global pollution.

### 5. **Top 3 Emitting Industries – Yearly Pattern**

We used `WITH` and `JOIN` queries to analyze and visualize how the emissions from the top three sectors have changed over time.

### 6. **Renewable Energy vs Emissions**

Countries with high renewable energy percentages generally showed lower per capita CO₂ emissions, suggesting a positive environmental impact.

### 7. **GDP vs Emissions Correlation**

Preliminary scatter plots and SQL data extraction hinted at a positive correlation between economic activity and emissions.
