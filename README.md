1. Covid data set project
   In this first project I will be using SQL to do some Data Exploration. 
   I will then visualize the data in Tableau for the next project.
   Link to Dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
   The dataset may have changed at the source since the data is populated on a daily basis since 2020

2. Nashville Housing Data cleaning project
   In these project I used sql to prepare a dataset for further data manipulation
   Tasks performed include: dealing with duplicates, formatting columns to the right data types, standardising columns to show the right data

3. Movie_data_correlation_python_project is my first python projectand it basically investigates the hypothesis that the budget of making       movies is directly proportional to the gross earnings from the movies. The project also looks into the relationship between all the          matrices in the data with each other to identify patterns and relationships
